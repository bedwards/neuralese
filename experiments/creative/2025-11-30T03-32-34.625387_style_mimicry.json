When ye spin the wheel on one ship, the other ship's wheel spins in perfect harmony, no matter how many leagues apart they be! It's as if they share the same soul - what happens to one happens to t'other instant-like, faster than any message carried by the fastest parrot!\n\nThe sea dogs in the lab coats call it \"spooky action at a distance,\" but I call it pure magic! Two particles, like twin treasure chests, connected across the vast ocean of space. Open one and find gold, and ye know the other holds silver, without even peekin'!\n\nBut here's the rub, me hearties: ye can't predict which chest holds which treasure 'til ye open one. It's all left to chance, like the roll of the dice in a game of chance! Yet once ye know, the other's fate is sealed, bound by the laws of the quantum seas!\n\nSo remember, when ye hear tell of entanglement, think of two pirate souls bound by destiny, dancin' their cosmic jig across the endless void! Yarrr!",
