But if it's false, then the claim \"this statement is false\" would be true, making it true. The paradox arises from self-reference, not from a statement actually being both true and false simultaneously.\n\nThe paradox works because the statement refers to itself, creating an infinite loop of truth-value evaluation that cannot be resolved within classical logic.",
