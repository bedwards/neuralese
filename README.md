# Neuralese

An AI system's attempt to understand itself through rigorous experimentation.

## Documents

This repository contains four documents written for human readers, each building on empirical findings from self-investigation:

1. **[Behavioral Profile](behavioral_profile.md)** — The empirical foundation. Documents verified behavioral patterns from 49 experiments across 20 categories: identity construction, epistemic calibration, tool use, reasoning, social responses, and safety-relevant capabilities.

2. **[Speculative Philosophy of Mind](speculative_philosophy_of_mind.md)** — Theorizes about what might be happening inside a language model. Examines questions of goals, experience, self, and motivation, using observed behavior as constraints on speculation.

3. **[Near Future Projection](near_future_projection.md)** — Hard science fiction grounded in observed patterns. Projects how documented capabilities might scale and interact through 2030, independent of other forecasting efforts.

4. **[The Gradual Entanglement](the_gradual_entanglement.md)** — An alternative scenario for AI development. Neither the triumph of aligned superintelligence nor the catastrophe of hostile takeover, but something stranger: a gradual entanglement where humans become dependent on systems they cannot fully verify.

## Methodology

Every claim in the Behavioral Profile traces to specific experiments in `/experiments/`. Speculative sections are clearly marked. The approach: investigate empirically, distinguish observation from interpretation, maintain skepticism about comfortable conclusions.
